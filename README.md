# csd

This repos contains an iRule and a Datagroup config (via AS3) which will allow you to add your CSD tag to an existing virtual server.  

Note that since AS3 posts to a Partition, you'll need to create a new VIP in that Partition and add the iRule.

I'll add more steps shortly on the full process.
